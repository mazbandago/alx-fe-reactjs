# React + Vite
# GitHub User Search Application

A responsive React-based web application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles using the GitHub API. Built as part of the ALX Front-End Web Development program, this project demonstrates API integration, advanced search capabilities, and deployment to Vercel.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This application enables users to:
- Search for GitHub users by username.
- View basic profile information including avatar, name, and profile link.
- Perform advanced searches using filters like location and repository count.
- Enjoy a clean, responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Setting up a React project for API integration.
- Making HTTP requests using Axios.
- Handling asynchronous data and conditional rendering.
- Enhancing UI/UX with Tailwind CSS.
- Deploying a production-ready app to Vercel.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **React** (Vite setup)
- **Axios** for API requests
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **GitHub API** for user data
- **Vercel** for deployment

## ðŸ“¦ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-user-search.git
   cd github-user-search

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
